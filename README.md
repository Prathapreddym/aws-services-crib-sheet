# AWS services crib sheet

A crib sheet in the form of an Excel file for AWS learners to take notes while following a course.

The list is not solely AWS services but also features of AWS services when the service is large like SageMaker and Systems Manager for instance.

There is an unofficial indication is the service should be learned for an AWS certification.

You can sort the rows by service or service category.

You can filter by certification.

Enjoy, hope it helps.
Happy Learning!
