# AWS services crib sheet

## Purpose

This repo holds a crib sheet in the form of an Excel file for AWS learners to take notes while following a course. Some columns are left intentionally blank to let students type their own words for long-term memory storage.

## Categories, services, features

Beware that this is not an official list of AWS services. Some services may be missing, some row may not be considered as a service. The list is not solely AWS services but also features when the service is large like Amazon SageMaker and AWS Systems Manager for instance. 

Categories are indicated per service/feature. Some services like Amazon Redshift might belong to several categories (Analytics, Database), but only one was chosen here.

You can sort the rows by service or service category.

## Certifications

There is also an **unofficial** indication if you should learn the service for a specific AWS certification. Beware that this is likely to be incomplete as certification questions are evolving.

You can filter the list of services by certification.

**Enjoy, hope it helps.**
**Happy Learning!**
