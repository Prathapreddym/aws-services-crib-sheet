# AWS services crib sheet

This repo holds a crib sheet in the form of an Excel file for AWS learners to take notes while following a course. Some columns are left intentionally blank to let students type their own words for long-term memory storage.

The list is not solely AWS services but also features when the service is large like Amazon SageMaker and AWS Systems Manager for instance. Some services like Amazon Redshift might belong to several categories (Analytics, Database), but only one was chosen here.

There is also an unofficial indication if you should learn the service for a specific AWS certification.

You can sort the rows by service or service category.

You can filter by certification.

Enjoy, hope it helps.
Happy Learning!
